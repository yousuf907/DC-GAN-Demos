# DC-GAN-Demos
A demonstration of **Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DC-GAN)** for producing celebrity faces and hand-written digits based on the paper titled 'Unsupervised Representation Learning with Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks' (https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06434) and the CelebA dataset (http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/CelebA.html) and MNIST dataset.
